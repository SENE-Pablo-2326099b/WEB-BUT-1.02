                1. The services we provide<br>
                Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. To help
                advance this mission, we provide the Products described below to you:<br>
                Provide, personalize and improve our Products:<br>
                Your experience on Facebook is unique to you and unlike anyone else's: from the posts, stories, events,
                ads (if we show you ads on Meta Products) and other content you see in Facebook News Feed or our video
                platform to the Facebook Pages you follow and other features you might use, such as Facebook
                Marketplace, and search. For example, we use information about the connections you make, the choices and
                settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products to personalize your
                experience.<br>
                For more information about how we use information to provide you with a personalised experience, please
                review our Privacy Policy.<br>
                We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organizations and others that matter to
                you across the Meta Products you use. We use the information we have to make suggestions for you – for
                example, groups to join, events to attend, Facebook Pages to follow or send a message to, shows to watch
                and people you may want to become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we
                believe that our Products are most useful when people are connected to people, groups and organizations
                that they care about. We want the content and suggestions that you see on Facebook to be as interesting
                and valuable to you as possible. Please see our Recommender Systems’ System Cards for information on how
                our various recommender systems prioritize signals to determine which content and suggestions to show
                you, as well as options for customizing your experience.<br>
                To help you discover content, products and services that may interest you, we show you offers and other
                sponsored or commercial content to help you discover content, products and services that are offered by
                the many businesses and organizations that use Facebook and other Meta Products.<br>
                Section 2 below explains this in more detail.<br>
                Our Products provide many ways to express yourself or communicate with friends, family, and others about
                what matters to you - for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos, and stories across the Meta
                Products (consistent with your settings), sending messages or making voice or video calls to a friend or
                several people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile as well as showing you
                insights on how others engage with your content. We have also developed, and continue to explore, new
                ways for people to use technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share more
                expressive and engaging content on Meta Products.<br>
                We engage in research to develop, test and improve our Products. This includes analyzing information
                that we have about our users, and understanding how people use our Products, for example by conducting
                surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features. We use and develop advanced technologies such as
                artificial intelligence, machine learning systems and augmented reality so that people can use our
                Products safely regardless of physical ability or geographic location. For example, technology such as
                this helps people who have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos shared on
                Facebook. We also build sophisticated network and communication technology to help more people connect
                to the Internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to improve our ability to
                protect our community and our Products.<br>
                For more information about how we use your information to provide, develop and improve Meta Products,
                please review our Privacy Policy.<br>
                Promote the safety, security, and integrity of our Products, combat harmful conduct and keep our
                community of users safe:<br>
                People will only build community on Meta Products if they feel safe and secure. We work hard to maintain
                the security (including the availability, authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality) of our Products
                and services. We employ dedicated teams around the world, work with external service providers, partners
                and other relevant entities, and develop advanced technical systems to detect potential misuse of our
                Products, harmful conduct towards others, and situations where we may be able to help support or protect
                our community, including to respond to user reports of potentially violating content. If we learn of
                content or conduct like this, we will take appropriate action that may include notifying you, offering
                help, removing or restricting content, removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling an
                account, or contacting law enforcement. Learn more about the restrictions we may impose on the use of
                Facebook, including information on how we apply our content policies, procedures, measures and tools
                here. We share information data with other Meta Companies when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by
                someone using one of our Products or to help keep Meta Products, users and the community safe. For
                example, we share information with Meta Companies that provide financial products and services to help
                them promote safety, security and integrity and comply with applicable law. Meta may access, preserve,
                use and share any information it collects about you where it has a good faith belief it is required or
                permitted by law to do so. For more information, please review our Privacy Policy.<br>
                In some cases, the Oversight Board may review our decisions, subject to its terms and bylaws. Learn more
                here.<br>
                Provide consistent and seamless experiences across the Meta Company Products, outside of our contract
                with you:<br>
                We design our systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless across the different Meta
                Company Products that you use depending on your choices. For example, we use information about the
                people you engage with on Facebook to make it easier for you to connect with them on Messenger, and we
                enable you to communicate with a business you follow on Facebook through Messenger.<br>
                Communicating with you:<br>
                We may need to send you communications, like emails or in-product notices, to respond to you or inform
                you about any product-related issues, research, or our terms and policies. For more information, please
                review our Privacy Policy.<br>
                Ensuring access to our Products:<br>
                To operate our global services and enable you to connect with people around the world, we need to
                transfer, store and distribute content and data to our data centers, partners, service providers,
                vendors and systems around the world, including outside your country of residence. The use of this
                global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Products. This infrastructure may be
                owned, operated, or controlled by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, or its
                affiliates. For more information about how we transfer, store or process your information, please review
                our Privacy Policy.<br>
                2. How our services are funded<br>
                You can choose to use our Products for free with ads or to subscribe to use without ads:<br>
                If you choose to use our Products for free with ads, you allow us to show you ads that businesses and
                organizations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Products.<br>
                If you choose to subscribe to use our Products without ads, you won’t see ads from us and we do not use
                your data for ads. The details of price, currency and payment period for the subscription for no ads
                will be provided to you before you complete your purchase.<br>
                Protecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our ads system. If we show you ads on Meta
                Products, we show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell
                your personal information and we don't share information that directly identifies you (such as your
                name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific
                permission. Instead, we allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal, and the kind of
                audience they want to see their ads (for example, people between the age of 18-35 who live close to the
                advertiser’s store in Portugal). We then show their ad to people who we think might find it
                relevant.<br>
                We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how
                people are interacting with their content on and off Meta Products. For example, we provide general
                demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience, like
                the fact that women between the ages of 25 and 34 who live in Madrid and like software engineering have
                seen an ad. We don’t share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or
                email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us
                specific permission. Learn more about how Meta ads work here.<br>
                You can learn about how we collect and use your information in our Privacy Policy, including more detail
                on the different types of information we use to show you ads (if we show you ads on Meta Products). You
                have controls over the types of ads and advertisers you see, and the types of information we use to
                determine which ads we show you. Learn more.<br>
                3. Your commitments to Facebook and our community<br>
                We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In exchange, we need you to
                make the following commitments:<br>
                1. Who can use Facebook<br>
                When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is safer and more accountable. For
                this reason, you must:<br>
                Provide for your account the same name that you use in everyday life.<br>
                Provide accurate information about yourself.<br>
                Create only one account (your own) and use it for personal purposes.<br>
                Not share your password, give access to your Facebook account to others, or transfer your account to
                anyone else (without our permission).<br>
                We try to make Facebook broadly available to everyone, but you cannot use Facebook if:<br>
                You are under 13 years old.<br>
                You are a convicted sex offender.<br>
                We've previously disabled your account for breaches of our Terms, the Community Standards, or terms and
                policies that apply to your use of Facebook. If we disable your account for a violation of our Terms,
                the Community Standards, or other terms and policies, you agree not to create another account without
                our permission. Receiving permission to create a new account is provided at our sole discretion, and
                does not mean or imply that the disciplinary action was wrong or without cause.<br>
                You are prohibited from receiving our products, services, or software under applicable laws.<br>
                2. What you can share and do on Meta Products<br>
                We want people to use Meta Products to express themselves and to share content that is important to
                them, but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of others or the integrity of our community.
                You therefore agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support others in
                doing so):<br>
                You may not use our Products to do or share anything:<br>
                That breaches these Terms, the Community Standards, and other terms and policies that apply to your use
                of our Products.<br>
                That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory, or fraudulent (or assists someone else in using our
                Products in such a way).<br>
                That you do not own or have the necessary rights to share.<br>
                That infringes or breaches someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights (such as
                by infringing another’s copyright or trademark, or distributing or selling counterfeit or pirated
                goods), unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law.<br>
                You may not upload viruses or malicious code, use the services to send spam, or do anything else that
                could disable, overburden, interfere with, or impair the proper working, integrity, operation, or
                appearance of our services, systems, or Products.<br>
                You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means (without our prior
                permission) or attempt to access data you do not have permission to access. We also reserve all of our
                rights against text and data mining.<br>
                You may not proxy, request, or collect Product usernames or passwords, or misappropriate access
                tokens.<br>
                You may not sell, license, or purchase any data obtained from us or our services, except as provided in
                the Platform Terms.<br>
                You may not misuse any reporting, flagging, dispute, or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent,
                duplicative, or groundless reports or appeals. Learn more about our policy on frequent submission of
                manifestly unfounded reports and complaints in our Misuse Policy.<br>
                We can remove, block or restrict content that is in breach of these provisions. We can also suspend or
                disable your account for conduct that violates these provisions, as provided in Section 4.2.<br>
                If we remove, block or restrict content that you have shared for violation of the Community Standards
                we’ll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or
                repeatedly violate these Terms or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our
                community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services,
                systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited
                from doing so for legal reasons. For information on account suspension or termination, see Section 4.2
                below.<br>
                To help support our community, we encourage you to report content or conduct that you believe breaches
                your rights (including intellectual property rights) or our terms and policies if this feature exists in
                your jurisdiction.<br>
                We also can remove, block or restrict access to content, features, services or information if we
                determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate misuse of our services or adverse
                legal or regulatory impacts to Meta.<br>
                Learn more about our Complaints Handling Process here.<br>
                3. The permissions you give us<br>
                We need certain permissions from you to provide our services:<br>
                Permission to use content you create and share: Some content that you share or upload, such as photos or
                videos, may be protected by intellectual property laws.<br>
                You retain ownership of the content that you create and share on Facebook and other Meta Company
                Products you use, and nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are
                free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want. To provide our services, though, we need
                you to give us some legal permissions to use that content.<br>
                However, to provide our services we need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a "license") to
                use this content. This is solely for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and services
                as described in Section 1 above.<br>
                Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on
                or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable,
                royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or
                display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and
                application settings). This means, for example, that if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us
                permission to store, copy, and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as Meta
                Products or service providers that support those products and services. This license will end when your
                content is deleted from our systems.<br>
                You can delete individual content you share, post, and upload at any time. In addition, all content
                posted to your personal account will be deleted if you delete your account. Learn more about how to
                delete your account. Account deletion does not automatically delete content that you post as an admin of
                a page or content that you create collectively with other users, such as photos in Shared Albums which
                may continue to be visible to other album members.<br>
                It may take up to 90 days to delete content after we begin the account deletion process or receive a
                content deletion request. If you send content to trash, the deletion process will automatically begin in
                30 days unless you choose to delete the content sooner. While the deletion process for such content is
                being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users. After the content is deleted, it may
                take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.<br>
                Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning
                in the following situations:<br>
                where your content has been used by others in accordance with this license and they have not deleted it
                (in which case this license will continue to apply until that content is deleted);<br>
                where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which
                case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or<br>
                where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:<br>
                investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to
                identify or investigate misuse of our Products or systems);<br>
                protect the safety, integrity, and security of our Products, systems, services, and users, and to defend
                ourselves;<br>
                comply with legal obligations for the preservation of evidence, including data Meta Companies providing
                financial products and services preserve to comply with any record keeping obligations required by law;
                or<br>
                comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement, or a government
                agency;<br>
                in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which
                it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).<br>
                In each of the above cases, this license will continue until the content has been fully deleted.<br>
                Permission to use your name, profile picture, and information about your actions with ads (if we show
                you ads on Meta Products) and sponsored or commercial content: Your name and profile picture and
                information about actions you have taken on Facebook can be used next to or in connection with ads,
                offers, and other sponsored or commercial content that we display across our Products, without any
                compensation to you. For example, we may show your friends that you are interested in an advertised
                event or have liked a Facebook Page created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Facebook.
                Ads and content like this can be seen only by people who have your permission to see the actions you've
                taken on Meta Products. You can learn more about your ad settings and preferences.<br>
                Permission to update software you use or download: If you download or use our software, you give us
                permission to download and install updates to the software where available.<br>
                4. Limits on using our intellectual property<br>
                If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our
                Products (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create
                or share on Facebook), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can only use our
                copyrights or trademarks (or any similar marks) as expressly permitted by our Brand Usage Guidelines or
                with our prior written permission. You must obtain our written permission (or permission under an open
                source license) to modify, translate, create derivative works of, decompile, or reverse engineer our
                products or their components, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us, unless an exception
                or limitation applies under applicable law or your conduct relates to the Meta Bug Bounty Program.<br>
                4. Additional provisions<br>
                1. Updating our Terms<br>
                We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our Products better for you
                and our community. As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately
                reflect our services and practices to promote a safe and secure experience on our Products and services,
                and/or to comply with applicable law. We will only make any changes if the provisions are no longer
                appropriate or if they are incomplete, and only if the changes are reasonable and take due account of
                your interests or if the changes are required for safety and security purposes or to comply with
                applicable law.<br>
                We will notify you (for example, by email or through our Products) at least 30 days before we make
                changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect, unless the
                changes are required by law. Once any updated Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you
                continue to use our Products.<br>
                We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms and no
                longer want to be a part of the Meta community, you can delete your account at any time.<br>
                2. Account suspension or <a href="scary.html"> termination </a><br>
                We want Facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their
                thoughts and ideas.<br>
                If we determine that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached our Terms or Policies, including
                in particular the Community Standards, we may suspend or permanently disable your access to Meta Company
                Products, and we may permanently disable or delete your account. We may also disable or delete your
                account if you repeatedly infringe other people’s intellectual property rights or where we are required
                to do so for legal reasons. Learn more about how we deal with repeated violations of our content
                policies here; and our Misuse Policy on frequent provision of manifestly illegal content is set out
                here.<br>
                We may disable or delete your account if after registration your account is not confirmed, your account
                is unused and remains inactive for an extended period of time, or if we detect someone may have used it
                without your permission and we are unable to confirm your ownership of the account. Learn more about how
                we disable and delete accounts.<br>
                Where we take such action we’ll let you know and explain any options you have to request a review,
                unless doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or
                interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are
                restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.
                Learn more about our Complaints Handling Process here.<br>
                You can learn more about what you can do if your account has been disabled and how to contact us if you
                think we have disabled your account by mistake.<br>
                If you delete or we disable or delete your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between
                you and us, but the following provisions will remain in place: 3.3.1, 4.2-4.5.<br>
                3. Limits on liability<br>
                Nothing in these Terms is intended to exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or
                fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence, or to affect your statutory rights.<br>
                We will exercise professional diligence in providing our Products and services to you and in keeping a
                safe, secure and error-free environment. Provided that we have acted with professional diligence, we do
                not accept responsibility for losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts;
                losses that are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; and
                events beyond our reasonable control.<br>
                4. Disputes<br>
                If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Meta Products as a consumer, both you
                and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our
                claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has
                jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to
                conflict of law provisions.<br>
                If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Meta Products in any other capacity,
                including, but not limited to, access or use of the Meta Products for a business or commercial purpose,
                or that an entity brings on your behalf, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a
                competent court in Ireland and Irish law will apply to such claim or dispute without regard to conflict
                of law provisions.<br>
                5. Other<br>
                These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities) make up the entire
                agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited regarding your use of our Products. They
                supersede any prior agreements.<br>
                Some of the Products we offer are also governed by supplemental terms. If you use any of these Products,
                you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to supplemental terms that will become part of our
                agreement with you. For instance, if you access or use our Products for commercial or business purposes,
                such as buying ads, selling products, developing apps, managing a group or Page for your business, or
                using our measurement services, you must agree to our Commercial Terms. If you post or share content
                containing music, you must comply with our Music Guidelines. If you have a subscription for no ads, then
                the No Ads Terms also apply. To the extent any supplemental terms conflict with these Terms, the
                supplemental terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.<br>
                If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the unenforceable portion will be deemed
                amended to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, and if it can’t be made enforceable,
                then it will be severed and the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to
                enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these
                Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.<br>
                You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to anyone else without our
                consent.<br>
                You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage your account if it is memorialized. If
                you enable it in your settings, only your legacy contact or a person who you have identified in a valid
                will or similar legal document expressing clear consent to disclose your content to that person upon
                death or incapacity will be able to seek limited disclosure of information from your account after it is
                memorialized.<br>
                These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of our rights and obligations under
                these Terms are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or
                by operation of law or otherwise.<br>
                We may need to change the username for your account in certain circumstances (for example, if someone
                else claims the username and it appears unrelated to the name you use in everyday life).<br>
                We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about our products and services. But we may use
                feedback and other suggestions without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we are under
                no obligation to keep them confidential.<br>
                If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes, this could result in
                a transfer of your information to the new owner.<br>
